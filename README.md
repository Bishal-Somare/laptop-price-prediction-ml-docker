````markdown
# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction System (Dockerized 🐳)

This project is a Machine Learning-powered system to predict laptop prices based on user inputs. It uses **Linear Regression** for predictions and is fully containerized using **Docker** for easy deployment and testing.

---

## 📦 Features

- Predict laptop prices using ML model
- Built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
- Fully Dockerized for seamless deployment
- Hosted Docker image available for pull and run

---

## 🐋 Pull and Run Docker Image

No need to clone the repo or install dependencies! Just pull the Docker image and run it directly from Docker Hub:

### 🔧 Prerequisites

  👉 [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

---

### 🧪 Run with Docker (One Command)

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 bishal521/laptopprice
````

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

You're now running the ML app inside a Docker container! 🎉

---

## 🛠️ Build Locally (Optional)

If you prefer to build the image yourself:

```bash
